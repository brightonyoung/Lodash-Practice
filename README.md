Hit ENTER multiple times to generate an empty and basic package.json.
Install lodash.
Use this blog on lodash to understand the power.
Use the lodash documentation.
Use this video to see how to use lodash.
Build a simple terminal app that uses at least 5 lodash methods.
Use fake data or APIs you have worked with in previous projects or google fake data you can use. Either make a fetch or save it in a few variables.
Console.log the output of each lodash method called on the fake data.
Use at least these methods: _.chunk(), _.reverse(), _.without(), _.shuffle().
Create unit tests with Mocha for each function you build.
TIP: use the data from day 11 for arrays and objects to tinker with. Or google fake data.

Continue on! After you finish these five, switch rolesâ€”navigator is now the driver and the driver is now the navigator.
Create 5 more inputs, buttons and displays for 5 more lodash methods.
Create unit tests for each of your functions.
